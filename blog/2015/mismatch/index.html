Putting a body designed in that environment into the one we have today is a <em>sacrilege</em> of it’s design.</p> <p>The cravings and aversions of the human body are meant to help us survive in the wild. When we put them to navigate the modern world. It’s no wonder that we go ashtray.</p> <p>This is the reason we can keep on scrolling instagram to no concievable end or binge eat junk food while binge watching netflix lying on a sofa. While being aware that it is hurting us all the time.</p> <p>These products chips, netflix or instagram are designed to hack the biological response and reward system of the human body. While our bodies are still trying to crave things that we might need in the wild where it isn’t easily available. The products that we see in front of us give us exactly that in optimized amounts to hit our bliss point.</p> <h2 id="salary">Salary</h2> <p>The response-reward system that would be the most important tool to help us differentiate what to do and what not to is skewed hacked and made use of by our current enviconrments. Even our society is based off of that.</p> <p>Just think of your salary. We get a little amount every month. Most of us have the feeling of having that short chilll of happiness even after decades of getting it. This is one way in which the current societal structure takes advantage of our design. Infact, the societal structure evolved to leverage on humans more than humans could leverage societal structure.</p> <p>Therefore, those who successfully navigate the social structure are few and they gain all of it while the rest of trapped in the tricks of our bodies with ancient designs are left out to survive.</p> <h2 id="instagram">Instagram</h2> <p>You know that endlessly scrolling instagram is bad for we but we do it anyway. It has hacked into so many of your biological systems. The craving to make social connections that would help us in the wild as people wihtout a society are to die first. We needed friend we could hunt with and trust them to share food. We also needed people to keep we from starving when we are sick and unable. We needed to have strong social connection made through chatting, gossiping, knowing what others are up to and so on. The current model of social media gives us all that wihtout the strong social connection and the great advantages that cam e in the real world. We already live in the virutal world that please our reward-response system.</p> <p>We also needed mates to reproduce. This is perhaps the most important thing(link back to medium article saying one predetermined goal of the human life is reproduction) for any organism “reproduction”. We did this by meeting people usually from our own social group, bonding with the healthier ones and then mating.</p> <p>So we are naturally inclined to like things like symmetry in body structure, big hips for women, tall-mascular men. Social media provides us a plethora of such specimen and we get hooked up to tit. If that wasns’t enough, surgeries can be performed to look attractive when attractive is simply a tool to find a good reproductive partner. IT has been hacked to do everything but that.</p> <h2 id="chips">Chips</h2> <p>Sweet and oily things are rich in energy. It is the fuel that the body needs to keep on going. Thus the reward-response mechanicsm for sweet and oily things is quite strong. These were scarce in the environemnt that our body evolved in and thus more was always good. Our cravings are therefore inclined to grab a lot of them when we can. This is simply not true in the current environment where more poeple die from <em>obesity each year than starvation</em>. Our mind is however still ancient, and the rewards in terms of feeling good are still quite high for oily and sweet food. Making us not only binge on them but also makin git a habit to do so. But in today’s world where <em>more people die of obesity each year than from starvation</em> it is a not true.</p> <h2 id="cheap-dopamine">Cheap Dopamine</h2> <p>What all of this means is that the dopamine that was a reward for something well done. The dopamine that would incite a rewards-response cycle to keep us from dying has been hacked in bizzare ways. The cheap dopamine environment of the modern world leads us to have a sedantary life full of unhealthy habits that push us into depression and death. *Make the depression point clearer. Maybe add that to the instagarm place. *Often these habits have a loop, we like watching TV and while watching Tv to have chips. These are both high dopamine activities and now whenever we watch TV we have an urge to have chips *When we are sad we scroll through IG which makes we more depressed as we compare, which makes we watch more of IG</p> <h2 id="the-aversion-pathways">The aversion pathways</h2> <ul> <li>Bitter things are usually poisonous</li> <li>Physical work is tiresome and wastes energy that might be needed later. Therefore it is a good idea to save energy and not do any physical work unless we have to.</li> <li>Mental work: We don’t want to be eaten away by a lion while we are seriously trying to find the formula for the height of a right angle triangle.</li> </ul> <p><img src="contraception.md" alt=""></p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 P.
